This is a jupyter notebook file containing an example of how to use recommender systems. There are 100 jokes and 1000 ratings of each of these jokes. A function within the notebook will take each 'user' individually and predict what their ratings would be.
It does this for every user then calculates the overall MAE. 

Later, this same dataset is used to simply find the k nearest neighbors, of a specified parameter k, to find the k most similar jokes in the dataset based on the user's ratings.
